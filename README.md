## How to Use

1. **Move your mouse** to smoothly rotate the cube - no clicking or dragging needed!
2. **Scroll/pinch** to zoom in and out on the cube
3. **Auto-rotate mode** - cube slowly rotates by itself after 2 seconds of no mouse movement
4. **Auto-snap feature** - when a face is nearly centered, the cube automatically snaps and pauses
5. **Hover over a square** - the cube freezes and the square highlights for easy clicking
6. **Click** on individual grid items to interact with them
7. **Click photos** in the gallery to view them full-screen (press Escape to close)

### Smart Click System
- **Auto-rotate**: Cube spins by itself when idle (after 2 seconds of no mouse movement)
- **Auto-snap**: Cube pauses when a face is directly forward for easy viewing
- **Complete freeze on hover**: Cube stops completely when you hover over any clickable item
- Cursor changes to pointer when over clickable items
- Squares glow when you hover over them
- Any mouse movement stops auto-rotation and gives you full control

### Navigation Tips
- **Hands-free mode**: Stop moving your mouse and the cube will auto-rotate slowly after 2 seconds
- **Take control**: Move your mouse at any time to stop auto-rotation and control the cube manually
- **Move mouse LEFT/RIGHT** to rotate horizontally and see all 4 side faces (Music, Gallery, Merch, Gigs)
- **Move mouse UP/DOWN** to tilt and see top/bottom faces (Bio, Videos)
- **Photo Gallery is on the BACK** - move mouse to far LEFT or far RIGHT to rotate around
- When you find a face you like, move mouse near center - cube will snap to that face
- Once snapped, the cube stays still so you can read and click items
- Hover over any square to freeze the cube completely for easy clicking

### Face Locations:
- **Front**: Music Player (default view)
- **Back**: 📸 Photo Gallery (rotate mouse far left or right)
- **Right**: Band Merch (move mouse right)
- **Left**: Upcoming Gigs (move mouse left)
- **Top**: Band Bio (move mouse up)
- **Bottom**: Music Videos (move mouse down)

## Customization Guide

### Changing Face Colors

In `index.html`, find the `faceContents` object and modify the color values:

```javascript
this.faceContents = {
    front: { type: 'music', title: 'Music Player', color: 0xff6b6b },
    // Change the hex color codes to your preference
}
```

### Adding More Songs

Find the `musicPanel` section and add more song items:

```html
<div class="song-item" data-song="songs/your-song.mp3">
    <h3>Your Song Title</h3>
    <button onclick="playSong('songs/your-song.mp3', this)">Play</button>
</div>
```

### Embedding Real Music Videos

Replace the placeholder divs with YouTube embed codes:

```html
<iframe width="100%" height="315" 
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOUR_VIDEO_ID" 
    frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```
